# lockd-etcd

Just like in `etcd`, the `d` in `lockd` stands for "distributed" â€” This is a service implementation for `wasi-cloud` that leverages `etcd` to provide distributed locking.

## How to Run the Examples

To run the examples for this, you need to have `etcd` installed. To do so, follow [these](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/) instructions. Next, when running the example, make sure you have an `etcd` server running.

> Note: To run an `etcd` server, just call `etcd` in your command-line.
